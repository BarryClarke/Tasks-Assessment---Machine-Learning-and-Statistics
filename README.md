[See here for instructions](https://github.com/BarryClarke/Tasks-Assessment---Machine-Learning-and-Statistics/blob/main/Ongoing%20tasks%20assessment.pdf)

## Description of files contained
### Solution1.ipynb: 
Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise.

### Solution2.ipynb:
Use scipy-stats to verify a result for the chi-squared value on a set of data, and to calculate the associated p value.

### Solution3.ipynb:
Perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation in Excel is a better estimate than the STDEV.P calculation (also in Excel) for the standard deviation of a population calculation when performed on a sample.
