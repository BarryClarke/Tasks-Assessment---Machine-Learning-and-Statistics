# Tasks-Assessment---Machine-Learning-and-Statistics
Repository for the Tasks assessment within Machine Learning and Statistics module


## Description of tasks
### Task 1
Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise.

### Task 2:
Use scipy-stats to verify a result for the chi-squared value on a set of data, and to calculate the associated p value.

### Task 3:
Perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation in Excel is a better estimate than the STDEV.P calculation (also in Excel) for the standard deviation of a population calculation when performed on a sample. 

### Task 4:
Use KMeans clustering algorithm on the Iris data set, discussing the accuracy and how it could be used to mae predictions.
