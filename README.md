# Tasks-Assessment---Machine-Learning-and-Statistics
Repository for the Tasks assessment within Machine Learning and Statistics module

## Scope
To complete 4 tasks throughout the semester, in line with course material, as directed by the lecturer.

## Description of tasks
### Task 1
Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise.

### Task 2:
Use scipy-stats to verify a result for the chi-squared value on a set of data, and to calculate the associated p value.

### Task 3:
Perform a simulation demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation in Excel is a better estimate than the STDEV.P calculation (also in Excel) for the standard deviation of a population calculation when performed on a sample. 

### Task 4:
Use KMeans clustering algorithm on the Iris data set, discussing the accuracy and how it could be used to make predictions.


### Running the notebook
The main body of work in this assignment is performed in a jupyter notebook. This includes description of solutions to all 4 tasks, with research references at the end of each task. If viewing through Github, the ipynb file is best viewed through nbviewer, as certain text formatting will not load correctly when viewing through GitHub. Please follow the below link to view the notebook in nbviewer  [Create a Data Set Project jupyter notebook]()
